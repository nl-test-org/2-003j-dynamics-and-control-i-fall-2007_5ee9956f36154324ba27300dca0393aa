description: Solutions to a homework assignment on calculating the trajectory of a
  ball dropping and bouncing with no drag force, calculating the trajectory of a ball
  dropping and bouncing with Stokes? drag, calculating the trajectory of a ball dropping
  and bouncing with quadratic drag, and a bonus question on calculating a more accurate
  trajectory of the ball with a given spatial resolution.
