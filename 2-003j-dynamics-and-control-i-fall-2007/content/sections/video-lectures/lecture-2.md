about_this_resource_text: '<p><strong>Disclaimer from Professor Sarma:</strong> A
  lecture is like a live performance &ndash; there are no retakes. So when you watch
  these videos, please keep in mind that I am human, and I make mistakes. For example,
  at minute 12 of the video of Lec #2 I make a mistake when I describe why the earth
  is an approximate inertial frame. What I mean to say is that the Earth, though moving,
  is accelerating relatively slowly with respect to some imaginary but real inertial
  frame when compared with, say a space-craft. So we treat it as an inertial frame,
  and experiments show that that is a good approximation. That''s not how I say it
  in the video, but the students did understand what I meant because the staff of
  the class interact with the students in a number of ways. So watch these videos
  but stay alert &ndash; and keep in mind that besides making mistakes, I also sometimes
  joke with my students.</p><p><strong>Topics:</strong></p><p>The &quot;spider on
  a Frisbee&quot; problem</p><p>Kinematics using first principles: &quot;downconvert&quot;
